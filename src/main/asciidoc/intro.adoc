Spring Cloud for Cloudfoundry makes it easy to run
https://github.com/spring-cloud[Spring Cloud] apps in
https://github.com/cloudfoundry[Cloud Foundry] (the Platform as a
Service). Cloud Foundry has the notion of a "service", which is
middlware that you "bind" to an app, essentially providing it with an
environment variable containing credentials (e.g. the location and
username to use for the service).

Add this project as a dependency to any Spring Cloud UI app or REST
service and deploy to Cloudfoundry.  If you use Spring Cloud Security
OAuth2 features this will make them bindable to Cloud Foundry services
instead of enironment properties in `oauth2.*`.  For a UI app you can
declare `@EnableOAuth2Sso` and bind to a service called "sso", and for
a service you can add `@EnableOAuth2Resource` and bind to a service
called "resource" (see below for how to change the names).
