/**
 * This example uses the Spring Cloud {@code DiscoveryClient} abstraction to list all
 * services available to the application. It should deployed to a Cloud Foundry
 * organization and space that has other applications deployed to it.
 *
 * There is a sample file in the project root called {@code hi-service.groovy} which can
 * be deployed using the {@code spring} CLI and the {@code cf} CLI that works
 * appropriately for this example.
 *
 * Either modify this application's {@code application.yml} configuration file to provide
 * credentials and other information for the Cloud Foundry the app is deployed to, or set
 * the following environment variables on the application (using {@code cf set-env}):
 *
 * * {@code CF_USERNAME} * {@code CF_PASSWORD} * {@code CF_ORG} * {@code CF_SPACE}
